## About the Site

The site is one page divided into 6 sections: A header section, about section, squads section, timetable section, contact section, annd a footer with social media links.

### Header Section
The header section is the first section of the site and consists of a hero image with an animation, a welcome message on top of the hero image, and some intro text.

### About Section
The about section consists of some text about the club and an image. The image was found on pexels. The image and texts were aligned using fload right and float left respectively. The text is used to offer some information on the club, its achivements, and its training locations and pool size. The image is used to lift the site a bit and add a bit of interest to the section. 

### Squads Section
The squads section offers information on the squads the club offers, from its Gold Squad that consists of National swimmers to its Learn to Swim section. The squads use alternating background colors and text colors, blue on white, and white on blue. This adds a bit of interest to the site, and adds to the design of the site. The colors are also Monson Swimming Clubs chosen colors, so they are used to reinforce the club.

### Timetable Section
The timetable section contains the timetables of all the squads. They again use the same blue background and white text as some of the squad designs, this ensures there are no major design changes and it follows with the flow of the website. The timetable may sound too demanding and unrealistic, especially for the top squads, but this is standard for a lot of clubs in the UK.

### Contact Section

This section is used to offer a bit of interactivity between the client and website owner. It gives a feeling of legitimacy and offers a sense of trust that this site is legit and the owner can be contacted with any questions on if they want mre information.

### Footer

The footer of the site contains their social media profiles. It is used as an alternative way of contacting the club, showing support for the club's achievemnts, and seeing what they have achieved at comeptetitions.


## Code Used

This site is written in HTML and CSS. HTML is used to provide the site's structure, such as the table element, and contact form, while CSS is used to add styling to the site, like the colouring of the site, and the sizing and positioning of images and text. Flexbox and CSS positioning are used to align items. Items that are two in a row, for example the about text and image, are aligned using the float positioning, whereas items of more than 2 in a row, for example the squads, are aligned using Flexbox. 

### Frameworks

Bootstrap is used to provide the collapsible menu on mobile. I used it as a way of providing the menu on mobile, without having to align the menu items vertivally on mobile in a straight line, as it adds a bit more style to the site.


## Design

The design of the site is a modern one, it draws on the use of whitespace between the text and images to create a modern look and feel, while still being easy to use. The site uses the club's main colours of blue (hexcodes #71bbd4 #62b4cf) to add style to the typography of the site, (the headers and the menu text for example) and lift the site against a white background.

### Typography

There are several fonts used in the site, Quicksand for the logo, Anton for the headers, and Poppins for the site text and menu links. I used Quicksand for the logo, with some letter spacing of 3px as it made the logo stand out, while keeping it simple, and not overtly showey or in your face, the spacing also allowed the letters some breathing space and along with the text-shadow of 1px, also helped making it stand out. The blue color is the same one to the rest of the site: #62b4cf, and set against the white background creates a nice contrast, while still making the site look clean and modern.

### Colors

The site's main colours are white and blue, as a reflection of the club's main colours. I chose these colours as they can create a nice contrast, and create a modern feel to the site. The colours used are: #62b4cf and #71bbd4. #71bbd4 is used solely for the menu, as a way of offering a slightly different shade to the logo and text, while still in keeping with the #62b4cf colour that is used in the headers and logo of the site. The white background is used to create whitespace, and a modern feel and look to the site. It also provides a nice contrast with the blue text, and when added with the black text-shadow in the texts, it creates an eyecatching look, for example in the squads section, the blue background and the white text of the Performance Squad section. 

### Images

There are four images used in the site, images are found on pexels and pixa bay (links to these images can be found in the credits section of this README) The images chosen aim to encourage people into swimming, and depict both training and competitive images. The header image:
<img src="images/hero-image">
is a training image of someone doing butterfly, the hardest stroke, which combined with the white welcome text, creates a sense of awe whie keeping the look modern and fresh. 


## Code Features

### Logo

### Nav Section

The navbar is a responsive menu. It uses the BootStrap collapsible dropdown menu on mobile, while on tablet, laptop and desktop, it expands and displays at the top of the site above the header image. It uses a white background and blue text set to the hexcode #71bbd4 to create a contrast between the blue text and the white background. It also represents Monson's blue logo and club colours.

BUGS:

In the navbar sometimes when you click the site jumps but doesn't scroll for some reaosn.

Toggle menu not centered on mobile: Overflow x and y were used to corect it and margin and padding. As well as align-content: center, and content-align: center on the div, and nav. Using overflow-x and setting it to hidden was the preferred option, as it closed the spacing significantly, however the navar wasn't viewable at all on phones in portrait mode, as it was still to far off screen. So for functionality it was considered best to have the overflow turned on so users could access the menu on portrait mode. 

Instagram not centered in div in footer, not sure why this is, its something to do with the padding mentioned in the #footer h2 in the css on desktop, but it is set to "text-align: center" in both, so should be centered but isn't.

Text not centered on mobile, not sure why this is.

Mention why fitness squads was rmeoved (it was placed below the red squad text and image, z-index, position relative and static where used to try to correct it.)
