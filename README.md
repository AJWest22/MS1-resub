Instagram not centered in div in footer, not sure why this is, its something to do with the padding mentioned in the #footer h2 in the css on desktop, but it is set to "text-align: center" in both, so should be centered but isn't.

Text not centered on mobile, not sure why this is.

Mention why fitness squads was rmeoved (it was placed below the red squad text and image, z-index, position relative and static where used to try to correct it.)
